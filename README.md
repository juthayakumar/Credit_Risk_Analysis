# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to use different Machine Learning techniques to determine which is the best to predit credit risk. To complete this analysis, the techniques used were:  RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier. These techniques were used to determine the best prediction and improve accuracy score.
## Results
  - The image below shows results for Random Oversampling. It shows that our balance accuracy was 66%, and the precision for high risk was a low positivity at 1%.
